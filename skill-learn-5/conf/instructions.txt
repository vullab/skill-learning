In this experiment, you will have to quickly respond to symbols.

On each trial, a symbol will appear, and you will have to make a response
by pressing one of the keys S, D, F, J, K, L.  These correspond (from left
to right) buttons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  Whenever a symbol appears, a 
response key will be displayed at the bottom of the screen indicating 
which symbols map on to which responses.

You might be warned before the appearance of the symbol which button you 
will have to press -- this will make your job easier.

Half-way through the experiment, the mapping between symbols and responses
might change -- if this happens, be sure to learn the new response mapping
quickly.

Good luck!
