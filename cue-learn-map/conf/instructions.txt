In this experiment, you will have to identify colors and letters. 
In each trial, a line will point to the letter we want you to identify. 
Your job is to identify the letter and the color of the cued "target". 

However you should NOT move your eyes from the fixation spot in 
the center of the screen. 

Use the numbers on your keyboard to select the correct answer
to each question. 

You will receive 1 point for correctly identifying 
the color of each target, and 1 point for correctly identifying 
the letter. Remember, it is important that you do not move your 
eyes from the fixation spot. 

Good luck!
